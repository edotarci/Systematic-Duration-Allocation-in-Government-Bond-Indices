# Duration-timing-on-Government-Bond-Indices-with-Factor-Macro-and-Market-signals

This thesis studies systematic duration-timing strategies in government bond markets, with the objective of assessing when dynamic maturity allocation improves risk-adjusted performance relative to equal-weighted benchmarks. The analysis is conducted using government bond indices segmented into four maturity buckets (1–3, 3–5, 5–10, and 10+ years) over the period 2005–2024.

The empirical investigation proceeds in several steps. First, factor-based strategies are examined on the World Government Bond Index (WGBI). Carry, value, and momentum signals contain economically meaningful information, but their standalone performance is limited and strongly regime dependent. Simple combinations of these signals, however, deliver more stable and robust duration-timing performance, even without expanding the information set. Second, the focus shifts to U.S. Treasuries, where the information set is extended to include macroeconomic, market, and foreign-exchange variables. Duration timing is framed as a classification problem across maturity buckets and addressed using machine-learning methods under strict constraints on model complexity and feature selection. We find that specific subsets of predictors carry economically relevant information, and that strategies built on these signals outperform an equal-weighted benchmark out of sample, with gains that remain economically meaningful after transaction costs. Third, simple threshold-based strategies are introduced to capture stress regimes using policy, inflation, volatility, and yield-curve indicators. These rule-based strategies underperform in stable environments but provide effective protection during periods of market stress.

Finally, the analysis is extended to a multi-country setting using Instrumented Principal Component Analysis (IPCA). In our implementation, where IPCA forecasts are mapped into duration-based portfolio decisions across countries and maturities, the approach delivers additional out-of-sample improvements across different portfolio construction methods. 

Overall, the results show that active duration timing can add economic value when signals are carefully combined and model complexity is tightly controlled, with different methodologies contributing in different market regimes.
