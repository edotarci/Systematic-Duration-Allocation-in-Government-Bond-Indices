# Duration-timing-on-Government-Bond-Indices-with-Factor-Macro-and-Market-signals
This thesis studies systematic duration-timing strategies in government bond markets, testing whether dynamic maturity allocation delivers risk-adjusted outperformance relative to an equal-weighted benchmark. The analysis is conducted using government bond indices segmented into four maturity buckets over the period 2005–2024. Statistical inference is conducted using HAC-based tests and block bootstrap procedures applied to net Sharpe ratio differences.

The empirical investigation proceeds in several steps. First, factor-based strategies are examined on the World Government Bond Index (WGBI). Carry, value, and momentum signals contain economically meaningful information, but their standalone performance is limited and regime dependent. Carry, as well as combinations that weight signals according to their past cross-sectional correlation with returns (the information coefficient, IC, approach), deliver the most robust results, with economically meaningful gains and partial statistical support, and represent the most defensible choices for practitioners in this setting.

Second, the focus shifts to U.S. Treasuries. Applying the same strategies, we find that outperforming the equal-weighted benchmark in terms of Sharpe ratios is substantially more difficult, and statistical significance is generally weak. The information set is therefore extended to include macroeconomic, market, and exchange-rate variables. Duration timing is implemented using machine-learning methods under strict constraints on model complexity and feature selection. While specific subsets of predictors generate out-of-sample gains that remain economically meaningful after transaction costs, statistical evidence of outperformance relative to the benchmark remains limited.

Third, simple threshold-based strategies are introduced to capture stress regimes using policy, inflation, volatility, and yield-curve indicators. These rule-based approaches underperform in stable environments but provide effective protection during periods of market stress, although they do not exhibit strong statistical significance.

Finally, the analysis is extended to a multi-country setting using Instrumented Principal Component Analysis (IPCA). Mapping IPCA forecasts into duration-based portfolio allocations across countries and maturities yields out-of-sample improvements and overall encouraging results. Under selected specifications, statistical significance at the 5\% level is achieved, while alternative configurations remain economically meaningful but less statistically robust.

Overall, the results indicate that active duration timing can generate economic value when signals are carefully combined and model complexity is tightly controlled. However, achieving statistical significance remains challenging, particularly in the U.S. Treasury market, likely reflecting its relatively high informational efficiency. From a practical perspective, several of the proposed strategies remain implementable and economically viable, offering structured tools for practitioners engaged in duration management.
